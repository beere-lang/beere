# Beere Programming Language

Beere is a simple, fast, and low-level programming language, designed for systems programming with modern syntax and manual memory control.

> ⚙️ Inspired by C, Java, Go and C++, but with better readability, more safety, easier to develop projects, and optional object-oriented programming.

## Features (that beere will have in the **first** release)

- Simple and clean syntax
- Optional object-oriented features
- C interoperability
- Optimizations (LLVM)
- Module system
- Full package manager system

## Status
> ⚠️ Beere is under active development.

## Progress
